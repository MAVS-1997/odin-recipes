    <p>Finally, here it is- The perfect french fries recipe! these hot chips are so crispy
    they stay that way even after they've gone cold.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>potatoes, The type is important. Starchy, floury potatoes are the potatoes you need for crispy fries.</li>
        <li>Vinegar, For simmering the potatoes, it is one secret weapon for perfect fries </li>
        <li>Salt, For seasoning the water so the potatoes are seasoned all the way through.</li>
        <li>Oil, for frying</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol class="ordered-list">
        <li><strong>CUT FRIES</strong>
            First, we have to cut our fries. A neat little crispy fries trick you may not have seen before: use a serrated knife to cut the potatoes. Though not visible to the eye, it makes the surface rougher therefore creating more surface area to crisp up
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>KEEP IN WATER TO PREVENT BROWNING</strong>
            Keep cut fries in water to prevent them from browning as you continue cutting. No soaking time is actually required. A simple rinse followed by simmering the potatoes in vinegar water takes care of this for us.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>RINSE</strong>
            Once all the fries are cut, place in a colander then rinse under tap water for 15 – 20 seconds. This is the first step to remove excess sugars from the surface of the potatoes.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>COOK IN VINEGAR WATER</strong>
            Once the potatoes are rinsed, place them in a pot with cold tap water, vinegar and salt. Bring to a boil on high heat then immediately turn down to low so the surface is barely rippling. Cook for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>DRAIN AND DRY</strong>
            Use a spider or large slotted spoon to remove the potatoes from the water into a colander. Then carefully spread the potatoes out on two tea towel-lined trays to steam dry for 5 minutes. No need to pat them dry, the residual heat will do the job for us
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>COOKING VESSEL AND OIL</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a heavy-based, large pot that is at least 10 cm deep</li>
            <li>Oil depth: 3cm. It's barely deep-frying, it's more like shallow-frying</li>
            <li>Safety headroom: 7cm headroom above the surface of the oil for safety purposes as the oil bubbles up quite a lot when we fry.  </li>
            <li>Oil temperature:  Preheat the oil to 205°C/400°F. Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>FRY #1</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Cook the fries in 3 batches:  Separate the cooked potatoes into 3 even piles (batches). We will be doing Fry #1 in three batches in a 24 cm / 10″ pot. If your pot is larger or smaller, adjust the number of batches accordingly so all the fries in one batch can float in a single layer in the oil.</li>
                <li>Add 1/3 of Batch #1: Using a spider or slotted spoon, carefully add 1/3 of the first batch into the oil.</li>
                <li>WAIT 10 seconds then add another 1/3 of batch #1. Pausing before adding more fries is important to ensure the oil doesn’t bubble up too high. Use this time to load up, ready to add more fries.</li>
                <li>Repeat: Wait 10 seconds, then add the final 1/3 of Batch #1.</li>
                <li>Fry 50 seconds: Once all the fries are in, start the timer and fry for 50 seconds, moving the fries around once or twice.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>COOL 30 MINUTES</strong>
            Remove the fries from the oil using a slotted spoon and spread onto a paper towel-lined tray in a single layer. They will be pale and not yet crispy.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>FRY #2 CRISP THEM UP!</strong>
            After cooling the fries, heat the oil to 205°C/400°F again. Now fry half all the french fries for 4 minutes until they are a gorgeous golden colour and wonderfully crispy.

            Remove with a slotted spoon into a large paper towel-lined bowl then repeat with the remaining fries.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>SEASONING!</strong> Now that your fries are done, sprinkle with salt or your favourite fries seasoning while hot so the salt sticks. Toss, then serve! Remember, these fries will stay crispy for more than 15 minutes, though of course they are best consumed piping hot!
